      "Homer_Simpson: What's the matter, Moe?\n",
      "Moe_Szyslak: Ah, business is slow. People today are healthier and drinking less. You know, if it wasn't for the Junior High school next door no one would even use the cigarette machine.\n",

      "Moe_Szyslak: You could, but I find this way is much more accurate... and fun.\n",
      "Collette: (DISGUSTED) what do you offer in the way of salary?\n",
      "Moe_Szyslak: Minimum wage and tips. (MEANINGFULLY) Of course there are fringe benefits.\n",

      "Moe_Szyslak: Ah, she left to pursue a movie career. Frankly I think she was better off here.\n",
      "Homer_Simpson: Moe, sorry I lost you hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n",
